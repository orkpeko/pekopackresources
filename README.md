## Whats the difference between sodium and optifine?
honestly, its all up to personal preference. i personally get more fps on [sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium) then [optifine](https://optifine.net/home) (12 chunk, inffancy by over 20). but you should test yourself to see which one is better
